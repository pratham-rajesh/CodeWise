# Quick Fix - View Your MongoDB Data

## 🔍 The Issue

You have a **different user ID** in localStorage than the one with data in MongoDB:

- **Current localStorage ID**: `user_snf6h24g1` (no data)
- **MongoDB has data for**: `user_da741dsxm` (has 3 credits, 20% success, 3 patterns)

## ✅ Quick Solution

### Option 1: Use Browser Console (Fastest!)

1. Open the browser **Developer Tools** (F12 or Right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Paste this command and press Enter:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('pattern_trainer_user_id', 'user_da741dsxm');
location.reload();
```

This will:
- Set your user ID to the one with MongoDB data
- Reload the page
- Show all your data (3 credits, 20% success, weak patterns)

### Option 2: Clear and Generate New Data

If you want to start fresh:

1. Open Console (F12)
2. Run:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('pattern_trainer_user_id');
location.reload();
```

3. Then complete some challenges to generate new data

## 🧪 Check What's Happening

The app now has **console logging** to show you what's happening:

1. Open Console (F12)
2. Look for these messages:
   - `👤 Current User ID:` - Shows which ID is being used
   - `🔍 Loading profile for user:` - Shows when profile is loading
   - `🌐 Fetching profile from:` - Shows the API URL
   - `📡 API Response:` - Shows what data came back
   - `✅ Profile loaded:` - Shows the parsed data

## 📊 Test the Fix

After setting the user ID to `user_da741dsxm`, you should see:

**Header**:
- 💎 Credits: **3**
- 🎯 Success: **20%**
- 🏆 Challenges: **3**

**Weak Patterns**:
- Sliding Window - 100% weak
- Binary Search - 100% weak
- Backtracking - 100% weak

## 🔧 Permanent Fix (Optional)

I can add a "Settings" panel to the UI where you can:
- View current user ID
- Switch between user IDs
- Clear data and start fresh

Would you like me to add that?

## 🎯 Quick Test Right Now

1. **Open Console** (F12)
2. **Run this**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('pattern_trainer_user_id', 'user_da741dsxm');
   location.reload();
   ```
3. **Check the header** - should show 3 credits, 20%, 3 challenges!
